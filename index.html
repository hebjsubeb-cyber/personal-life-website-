        This is the first time I arrived at Pittsburgh, starting my college life.
        I stood on the top of the signature incline and viewed the entire downtown.

        I went to Seattle on a random weekend. It was a foggy day with a nice and smooth mood,
        looking at the bay and listening to the noise from Pike Place Market.

        I spent New Year's Eve 2024–2025 in downtown Miami, watching the yachts and fireworks under the bridge,
        listening to Caribbean-style music at Bayfront Park, and dancing with the locals.
        It was incredibly lively and immersive.

        In the heart of Paradise, Las Vegas, a Statue of Liberty made me feel like I was back in New York,

        During my freshman summer break, I took a road trip along Highway 1 in California.
        Stopping at the UCSB campus, we admired the ocean and one of the most beautiful campuses in the U.S.
        I felt relaxed, yet strangely envious of the students there.

        Watching the sunset outside Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, slightly tipsy after a tequila drink,

        Arriving in Florida for the first time, I was excited to see the state sign on Interstate 95.
